# Sounding Poetry of Perception

## Description
In Sounding Poetry, textual descriptions become a score for sound compositions, where different words correspond to field recordings and sounds. The created soundscape is composed by oneâ€™s interpretation of his/her own visual experience into words.

This repository will try to improve the original [project](https://github.com/pepaivanova/Sounding-Poetry-of-Perception/tree/master) and make it work as a stand alone website.
